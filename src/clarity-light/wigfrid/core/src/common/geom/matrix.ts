/**
 * The Matrix class represents a transformation matrix that determines how to
 * map points from one coordinate space to another. You can perform various
 * graphical transformations on a display object by setting the properties of
 * a Matrix object, applying that Matrix object to the <code>matrix</code>
 * property of a Transform object, and then applying that Transform object as
 * the <code>transform</code> property of the display object. These
 * transformation functions include translation(<i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
 * repositioning), rotation, scaling, and skewing.
 *
 * <p>Together these types of transformations are known as <i>affine
 * transformations</i>. Affine transformations preserve the straightness of
 * lines while transforming, so that parallel lines stay parallel.</p>
 *
 * <p>To apply a transformation matrix to a display object, you create a
 * Transform object, set its <code>matrix</code> property to the
 * transformation matrix, and then set the <code>transform</code> property of
 * the display object to the Transform object. Matrix objects are also used as
 * parameters of some methods, such as the following:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The <code>draw()</code> method of a BitmapData object</li>
 *   <li>The <code>beginBitmapFill()</code> method,
 * <code>beginGradientFill()</code> method, or
 * <code>lineGradientStyle()</code> method of a Graphics object</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A transformation matrix object is a 3 x 3 matrix with the following
 * contents:</p>
 *
 * <p>In traditional transformation matrixes, the <code>u</code>,
 * <code>v</code>, and <code>w</code> properties provide extra capabilities.
 * The Matrix class can only operate in two-dimensional space, so it always
 * assumes that the property values <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> are 0.0,
 * and that the property value <code>w</code> is 1.0. The effective values of
 * the matrix are as follows:</p>
 *
 * <p>You can get and set the values of all six of the other properties in a
 * Matrix object: <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>,
 * <code>d</code>, <code>tx</code>, and <code>ty</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Matrix class supports the four major types of transformations:
 * translation, scaling, rotation, and skewing. You can set three of these
 * transformations by using specialized methods, as described in the following
 * table: </p>
 *
 * <p>Each transformation function alters the current matrix properties so
 * that you can effectively combine multiple transformations. To do this, you
 * call more than one transformation function before applying the matrix to
 * its display object target(by using the <code>transform</code> property of
 * that display object).</p>
 *
 * <p>Use the <code>new Matrix()</code> constructor to create a Matrix object
 * before you can call the methods of the Matrix object.</p>
